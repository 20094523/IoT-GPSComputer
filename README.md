# IoT-GPSComputer
Final year project involving IoT, an Arduino and a lot of GPS calibration.

Upload the code provided in this repository into your arduino. 
Connect your bluetooth sensor's VCC pin to 5V on your arduino. GND to GND. RX to pin 5 and TX to pin 4.
Connect your distance sensor's GND to GND, VCC to 5V, Echo to pin 2 and Trig to pin 3.

Once the arduino is powered on with all of its connections secure, go on your phone and connect to the HC-05 bluetooth, a password might be asked of you so just input 1234 or 0000.
Download the apk provided in the repository, run it, click the scan button. Choose the HC-05 module to connect to (youll know its highlighted when it turns yellow), click connect.

You now have a completely offline way to display and store sensor data. The total variable on the bottom left of the screen can be saved using the Save Data button,
so that the next time you launch the app, you'll start off from the total you saved. Deleting does what you'd expect.
